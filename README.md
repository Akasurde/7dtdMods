EricMods (Alpha 17)
===================

A bunch of stuff I've trown in together to tweak the game. My aim is to make things more pleasant without impacting the difficulty and mechanics of the game.

All the storage containers that can be selected with the new crateble **Wooden Storage / Furniture** have the same number of container slots (8 x 9). The containers in questions are: Storage Box, Cabinet, Cupboard, Bookcase, Pillcase, Dresser, and Wooden Desk.
