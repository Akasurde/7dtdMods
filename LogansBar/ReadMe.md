Installation
============

For stand alone PC installation
-------------------------------

Copy the files located from the mod Prefabs folder into your local 7 Day do Die `Data/Prefabs` folder.

Copy the LogansBar folder into your 7 Days do Die `Mods` folder.


For dedicated server installation
---------------------------------

It's pretty much the same thing then the stand alone PC installation, you copy the mod folder into the server `Mods` folder and the prefab files into the server `Data/Prefabs` folder.

**Important:** Each player must also install the prefab files locally as they would do for the stand alone PC installtion.

How to use the mod
==================

Once the mod installed, randomly generated worlds will have a chance to spawn the Logan's Bar. You just have to generate a new world and there is a good chance that the bar will be in there somewhere.

As you may guess, this will only work with newly generated worlds. Any world that was generated before you installed the mod will not spawn Logan's Bar.
