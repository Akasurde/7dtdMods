Installation
============

For stand alone PC installation
-------------------------------

Copy the LogansBar folder into your 7 Days do Die `Mods` folder.


For dedicated server installation
---------------------------------

It's pretty much the same thing then the stand alone PC installation, you copy the mod folder into the server `Mods` folder. 

There should be no need for the players to install the modlet, the require games files will be downloaded from the server when the players connect to the game.

How to use the mod
==================

Once the mod installed, randomly generated worlds will have a chance to spawn the Logan's Bar. You just have to generate a new world and there is a good chance that the bar will be in there somewhere.

As you may guess, this will only work with newly generated worlds. Any world that was generated before you installed the mod will not spawn Logan's Bar.
