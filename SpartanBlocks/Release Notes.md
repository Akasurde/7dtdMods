**SpartanBlocks** is a 7 Days to Die modlet that adds Grand Spartan branded blocks and other related items.

* 1.0: Fist official version which includes
	- Spartan Cube with recipe
	- Flag Pole, Flag Canvas, and Spartan Flag with recipes

None of this would have been possible without Xith work on FunWithFlags and his video tutorials.
